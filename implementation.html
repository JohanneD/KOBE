        <h1>Robot Implementation</h1>
        <h2>Attack</h2>
        <p>For this strategy we want to be as fast as possible while remaining precise.

        <h2>Defence</h2>
        <p>For this phase we want to put distraction balls on the arena so that the other robots score our fake balls instead of the ones that would earn them points.
            We then throw the real balls out of the way.
        </p>
        We want to score the initial ball (the one that is in the robot in the beginning) then go to the line of the attacker's area to grab and throw each ball.<p>
