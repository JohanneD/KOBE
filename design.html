            <h2 style="text-align: left;">I]Our vision</h2>
            <p>Our robot is called Kobe.
                We created Kobe with two goals in mind: Simplicity and efficiency.
                Our robot will therefore only rely two motors to navigate.  He uses a gyroscope, a colour sensor and a touch sensor to know where he is in the arena.
                Finally to grab and throw the balls we fitted him with a pair of rotating arms.
            <p>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">II]Actuators</h2>
            <p>Kobe's main limbs are four motors.  Navigation is insured by two motors.  
                One motor is used for grabbing balls. The last motor's purose is to trow the ball.
            </p>
                
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">III]Sensors</h2>
            <p>We spent a lot of time trying endow Kobe with the gift of sight (through a sonar) but didnt manage because of interferences with the opponent's sonars. 
                Therefore it uses a gyroscope to find the angle and a colour sensor to know how far we are.
            </p>
