        <h1>Robot design</h1>

        <h2>I]Our vision</h2>
        <p>Our robot is called Kobe.
            We created Kobe with two goals in mind: Simplicity and efficiency.
            Our robot will therefore only rely two motors to navigate.  He uses a gyroscope, a colour sensor and a touch sensor to know where he is in the arena.
            Finally to grab and throw the balls we fitted him with a pair of rotating arms.
        <p>

        <h2>II]Actuators</h2>
        <p>Kobe's main limbs are four motors.  Navigation is insured by two motors.  
            One motor is used for grabbing balls. The last motor's purose is to trow the ball.
        </p>
            
        <h2>III]Sensors</h2>
        <p>We spent a lot of time trying endow Kobe with the gift of sight (through a sonar) but didnt manage because of interferences with the opponent's sonars. 
            Therefore it uses a gyroscope to find the angle and a colour sensor to know how far we are.
